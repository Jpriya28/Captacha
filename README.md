# Captacha

A CAPTCHA (Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart) generator and verifier is a mechanism designed to distinguish between human users and automated bots.

# Key Components

**CAPTCHA Generator:

Randomly generates a string or pattern (letters, numbers, or a combination of both).

Provides a refreshing option to regenerate the CAPTCHA if the user cannot read it.

**CAPTCHA Verifier:

Provides an input field for the user to enter the CAPTCHA text.

Compares the user's input with the generated CAPTCHA value.

If the input matches, the user is validated as human.

If the input fails, prompts the user to try again.

# How It Works

**Generate CAPTCHA:

When the page loads, a random CAPTCHA string is generated (e.g., "5A7X3").

The CAPTCHA is displayed as an text with visual distortion.

**User Input:

The user types the characters they see in the CAPTCHA.

**Verification:

On form submission, the input is compared with the generated CAPTCHA string.

If the input matches, the captacha is correct; otherwise, the capatcha is not correct.
